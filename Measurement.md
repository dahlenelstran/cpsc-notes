## Measurement in the Z-Basis
- Although the laws of quantum mechanics permit this superposition of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, it also demands that if we measure the qubit, such as at the end of a computation in order to read the result, we get a single, definite value.
- The probability is given by the norm-square of the amplitude. 
- Example: $\frac{2}{3}|0\rangle + \frac{1-2i}{3}|1\rangle$ 
	- Calculating the Norm Square: $$|\frac{2}{3}|^2 = \frac{4}{9}$$ and $$|\frac{1-2i}{3}|^2=\frac{1-2i}{3} \frac{1+2i}{3} = \frac{1+2i-2i-4i^2}{9}=\frac{5}{9}$$
- Measurement collapses the qubit
- We say a quantum state is normalized if it's total probability is $1$, as it should be. Sometimes, we must find an overall normalizatoin constant to make this true. For example, a qubit is in the state: $A(\sqrt{2}|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$.
