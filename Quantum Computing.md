- This enables exponential speedup compared to classical computers
- Qubits are the basic units of information that represent quantum states, like bits in classical computers
- Total parts include: qubits, control electronics, cryogenic systems, and software stack
- The future of quantum computing:
	- more qubit control, error correction implementation, quantum algorithms development, quantum software tools availability
- Comparing *Classical* vs. **Quantum** Computers:
	- Fundamental Unit: *[[Bit]]* vs. **Qubit**
	- Gates: *Logic Gates* vs. **Unitary Gates**
	- Gates Reversible: *Sometimes* vs. **Always**
	- Universal Gate Set: *NAND* vs. **H, T, CNOT**
	- Programming Language Example: *Verlog* vs. **Open QASM**
	- Algebra: *Boolean* vs. Linear
	- Error Correcting Code Example: *Repetition Code* vs. **Shor Code**
	- Complexity Class: *P* vs. **BQP**
	- Strong Church-Turing Thesis: *Supports* vs. **Possibly violates**
