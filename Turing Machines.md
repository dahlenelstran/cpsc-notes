- While circuit-based computers are very useful in practice, they are not always the best kind of computer to study mathematically. 
- A Turing Machine is:

	- A tape divided into cells, each with a symbol from some finite alphabet. The left end of the tape is denoted by $\triangleright$, and the right end of the tape can extend as far as needed, here as an example the remaining cells can contain nothing, 0, or 1. 
	- A head can read or write to the tape, and then move left one cell$(\leftarrow)$, right one cell $(\rightarrow)$, or stay put $(*)$. 
	- A register stores the state of the Turing Machine. Only a finite number of states are allowed. Two special states are required, a starting state $q_1$ and a ==GET REST FROM SLIDE==
