- While circuit-based computers are very useful in practice, they are not always the best kind of computer to study mathematically. 
- A Turing Machine is:

	- A tape divided into cells, each with a symbol from some finite alphabet. The left end of the tape is denoted by $\triangleright$, and the right end of the tape can extend as far as needed, here as an example the remaining cells can contain nothing, 0, or 1. 
	- A head can read or write to the tape, and then move left one cell$(\leftarrow)$, right one cell $(\rightarrow)$, or stay put $(*)$. 
	- A register stores the state of the Turing Machine. Only a finite number of states are allowed. Two special states are required, a starting state $q_1$ and a ==GET REST FROM SLIDE==

## Church-Turing Thesis
- The **Church-Turing Thesis** says that everything that is computable can be computed with a Turing Machine, although it could take a long time
- The Strong Church-Turing Thesis says that any model of computation, be it the circuit model or something else, can be simulated by a *probabilistic Turing Machine* (a Turing machine where the state of the system can be set probabilistically, such as by the flip of a coin) with at most polynomial overhead.
	- Quantum Computers would not violate the regular Church-Turing Thesis. The hope, however, is that quantum computers can violate the Strong Church-Turing Thesis, that they will efficiently solve problems that are inefficient on classical computers. While there is no proof of this hope, there is strong evidence. 
- The complexity class of problems efficiently solved by a quantum computer is called $BQP$. It stands for Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time.
